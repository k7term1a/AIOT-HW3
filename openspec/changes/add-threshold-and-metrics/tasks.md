## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Expose `spam_score` from evaluation using `predict_proba` column 1
- [ ] 1.2 Add threshold slider and recompute confusion matrix/precision/recall/F1
- [ ] 1.3 Implement ROC/PR curves and AUC (scikit-learn metrics)
- [ ] 1.4 Plot precision and recall vs threshold (0.0–1.0 sweep)
- [ ] 1.5 Add “Download scored test set” button (CSV: text, true_label, spam_score, pred_at_threshold)
- [ ] 1.6 Refactor evaluation helpers for reuse and clarity
- [ ] 1.7 Sanity test on a small sample for correctness
